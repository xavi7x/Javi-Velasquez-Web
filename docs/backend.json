    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. The `owners` collection stores owner information, enabling authentication and authorization based on their `uid`. The `projects` collection stores project data. The `contactFormSubmissions` collection stores user-submitted contact form data. This structure facilitates secure `list` operations by segregating data with different access requirements into distinct collections. The segregation also simplifies security rule creation, reducing complexity. The structure leverages path-based ownership for owner data and maintains data clarity through explicit state modeling and predictable schema. Because all collections are root-level, there is no reliance on `get()` calls to authorize based on parent documents, thus achieving Authorization Independence. Authentication will be managed using Firebase Authentication."

/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the portfolio and client portal.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model for all client-related data,
 * ensuring that a client can only access their own projects, tickets, and invoices.
 * The website owner has administrative access to all data. Public project
 * listings remain readable by anyone.
 *
 * Data Structure & Auth Logic:
 * - /owners/{uid}: Document ID is the Firebase Auth UID. Existence of this doc marks the user as an owner.
 * - /clients/{uid}: Document ID is the Firebase Auth UID. Links a user to their client data.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Contains a `clientId` field. Rules match `request.auth.uid == resource.data.clientId`.
 * - /tickets/{ticketId}: Contains a `clientId` field.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Contains a `clientId` field.
